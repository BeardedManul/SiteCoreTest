---------------------------------- User Manual ----------------------------------

When I wrote this app I tried to use all my knowledge, but unfortunately I was not able to perform 100% of the job.

When you start the app you will see a list of books that are available to be taken, their titles, 
authors, the number of takes, whether they are taken by someone at the moment and the name of the person who took them.

You can also take the book, if it is available, for this you need to click on the link near the book,
and go to a page to fill your personal information. 
Here you need to enter your name and email address.


If the book was available at the time of capture, then on the home page the takes counter will increase by 1, 
the book will be unavailable for the taking, and your name will be displayed in the owners bar.

That's the short user manual for my app, and I hope this will be enough to advance to further stages of employment.
